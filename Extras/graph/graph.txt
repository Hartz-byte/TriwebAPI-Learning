Graph
A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are used to represent relationships between entities, making them a versatile and powerful tool in computer science and various applications.

Basic Concepts:
- Vertices (Nodes): The fundamental units in a graph. Each vertex represents an entity.
- Edges: Connections between pairs of vertices. Edges can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way).
- Weighted Graph: A graph in which edges have weights (costs or distances) associated with them.
- Unweighted Graph: A graph in which edges do not have weights.

Types of Graphs:
1. Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction, meaning they go from one vertex to another.
2. Undirected Graph: Edges do not have a direction; they connect vertices in both directions.
3. Weighted Graph: Edges have weights, indicating the cost to travel from one vertex to another.
4. Unweighted Graph: Edges are treated equally with no associated costs.
5. Cyclic Graph: A graph containing at least one cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex).
6. Acyclic Graph: A graph with no cycles.

How Graphs Work
Graphs can be represented in two main ways:
1. Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array where each cell indicates whether a pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
2. Adjacency List: An array of lists where each list contains the neighbors of a vertex. This representation is more space-efficient for sparse graphs.


Shortest Path in Graphs
Finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph is a common problem. Several algorithms can be used to solve this problem, depending on the characteristics of the graph (e.g., weighted vs. unweighted).

Common Shortest Path Algorithms:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Efficiently finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.
2. Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Handles graphs with negative weights and can detect negative cycles.
3. A Search Algorithm*: An extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses heuristics to improve efficiency in pathfinding problems.
4. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: A dynamic programming approach that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
