What is a Queue?
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

How Does a Queue Work?
Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
Peek/Front: Retrieves the front element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checks whether the queue is empty.

Why Do We Use Queues?
Queues are used in scenarios where order needs to be preserved and tasks need to be processed in the order they arrive.

Applications of Queues:
1. Task Scheduling: In operating systems, processes are scheduled in a queue. The CPU handles tasks in the order they arrive.
2. Message Queues: In messaging systems, messages are queued up to be processed in the order they were sent.
