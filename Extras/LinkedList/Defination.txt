LinkedList is a linear data structure where elements are stored in a sequence, and each element (called a node) contains a reference to the next element in the sequence. This creates a chain of nodes.

Types of Linked Lists:
Singly linked list: Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
Doubly linked list: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence.
